<sub><b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of this report is to contrast Curry and Durant's performances beyong 3pt line</br></sub>
<sub><b>Method:</b> Using python to scrap data from espn and transform them as spreadsheets; with pandas, seaborn and matplotlib to visaulize their performance and produce an analytics report.

<sub><b>Chart 1:</b> Histogram: SCs curve is closer to normal distribution, signifying a more stable perfromance in general and a less dispersed std</br></sub>
<sub><b>Chart 2:</b> Bar: SC made 8000+ 3pt shots, whereas still sustain a 3pt% over 42, thus the quality does not compromise for high quantity</br></sub>
<sub><b>Chart 3:</b> Scatter: SC's 3pt% goes up as he shoots more; however, players typically are the other way around due to fatigue and etc.</br></sub>

<sub><b>Conclusion:</b> both players are great, but SC30's performance beyond the 3pt line is just phenomenal</br></sub>
